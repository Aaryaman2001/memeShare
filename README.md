# memeShare

Learnings: 

This MemeShare app helped me understand how API calls work in Android Studio and how to set up external Android calls into your projects using the Intent. 

Libraries Used:

Volley: Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking very easy and fast, for Android apps. 

Glide: Glide is an Image Loader Library for Android developed by bumptech and is a library that is recommended by Google.


Volley was used to make API call and extract the url in JSON format., while Glide was used to load the URL onto the event screem.


HOW TO OPEN, USE: 

For your convenience, I have extracted the .apk file and merged it into the git repository, just download the .apk file and run the app on an anroid device.
